# Magic Generator Project

## Purpose
The Magic Generator project is designed to create magical outputs based on user inputs. It uses the Aineko framework to process data in real-time, transforming inputs into enchanting results that can be used in various applications.

## Design
The project consists of a single node, `MagicNode`, which performs the core functionality of the magic generation. The node listens for incoming data on the `user_input` dataset, applies a magical transformation, and writes the result to the `magical_output` dataset.

## Pipeline
The pipeline is configured to use Kafka streams for both input and output datasets, ensuring a seamless flow of data. The `MagicNode` is set up with half a CPU to handle the computations efficiently.

To run the pipeline, simply execute the `magic-generator-pipeline.yml` configuration file with the Aineko framework. The system will automatically handle the rest, providing magical outputs as desired.
