# Powerful Application

## Overview

Powerful Application is a robust and efficient data processing application designed to handle a variety of data transformation tasks. The application is built using the Aineko framework, which allows for real-time data streaming and processing.

## Nodes Design

The application consists of a `DataProcessorNode` which is responsible for consuming data from the `input_dataset`, processing it according to the business logic, and then producing the processed data to the `output_dataset`. The node is designed to be flexible and can be extended to implement specific data processing requirements.

## Pipeline Design

The pipeline configuration is defined in `pipeline.yml`, which sets up the `data_processor` node with input and output datasets. The pipeline is designed to be scalable and can be extended with additional nodes and datasets as needed.

## Getting Started

To get started with Powerful Application, you can refer to the `aineko.yml` for project metadata, `nodes.py` for the node implementation, and `pipeline.yml` for the pipeline configuration. The `README.md` provides a summary of the project and its design.
