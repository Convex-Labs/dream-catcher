# CoolProject

## Overview

CoolProject is designed to perform a cool functionality within a streaming data context. It leverages the Aineko framework to process data in real-time, ensuring that the cool feature is executed efficiently and effectively.

## Nodes Design

The `CoolNode` is the core computational unit of the CoolProject. It initializes its state using the `_pre_loop_hook` method and executes its main logic in the `_execute` method. The node is designed to be flexible and can be adapted to various cool functionalities as required by the project.

## Pipeline Design

The pipeline configuration is defined in `pipeline.yml`, which sets up the `CoolNode` and the `cool_output` dataset. The `CoolNode` consumes input data, processes it according to the cool functionality, and produces the result to the `cool_output` dataset. This setup allows for seamless integration of the node within the Aineko streaming data framework.
