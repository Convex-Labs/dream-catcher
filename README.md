# Something Awesome

This project contains an Aineko pipeline that does something awesome. The pipeline consists of a single node, `AwesomeNode`, which produces a message indicating something awesome.

## Design

The `AwesomeNode` is a simple example of an Aineko node that does not consume any input datasets. Instead, it uses its `_execute` method to produce an output message to the `awesome_output` dataset. This message is a simple dictionary with a key 'message' and a value 'This is something awesome!'.

The node logs an info level message every time it produces the output. The node's state can be initialized with the `initial_state` parameter, which is set to 'awesome' by default.

## Pipeline

The pipeline configuration in `pipeline.yml` defines the `AwesomeNode` and its output dataset `awesome_output`. The `awesome_output` dataset is of type `kafka_stream`, which means it can be consumed by other nodes or external systems in real-time.

To run this pipeline, you would use the Aineko framework's CLI tools to start the pipeline execution. Once running, the `AwesomeNode` will continuously produce the awesome message to the `awesome_output` dataset.
