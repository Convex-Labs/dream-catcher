# CoolProject

## Overview

CoolProject is designed to perform a cool operation on incoming data. It takes input from a Kafka stream, processes it through a custom node, and outputs the transformed data back to another Kafka stream.

## Nodes Design

The `CoolNode` is the core of CoolProject. It initializes with a default state and listens for incoming messages from the `cool_input` dataset. Upon receiving a message, it performs a 'cool' transformation and outputs the result to the `cool_output` dataset.

## Pipeline Design

The pipeline is configured with a single node, `CoolNode`, which is connected to both input and output datasets. The input dataset `cool_input` feeds data into the node, and the output dataset `cool_output` receives the processed data. This setup allows for real-time processing of streaming data.

To run the pipeline, ensure that the Kafka streams are correctly set up and that the Aineko framework is properly configured to interact with these streams.
